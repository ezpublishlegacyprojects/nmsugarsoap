# If this line is uncommented, the results of the contacts list will be cached
# This will significantly improve the performance when editing objects containing
# a "Sugar contacts" attribute.
# NB. This is a potential security risk as it could expose your entire contacts list
# to anyone who knows the URL to the cached file. You can improve security by changing
# the path to the contacts list cache file.
